Documentation

### Wiki plugin

Wiki is based off of taiga.io's project [wiki module](https://taiga.pm/the-wiki-module/). The budget plugin was modified to create this plugin. The main reason for this plugin is behind the need to keep project documentation together with a project and give access to the same user listing. This is also the solution to [issue 358](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/issues/358). There are many chat integrations that kanboard has and many wikis out there. However, none of the open-sourced wikis or any I'm aware of have great integrations that easily share users with other solutions.

This section is available from project settings page: **Project > Wiki**. There is also a shortcut from the drop-down menu on the board.

### Supported

- Simple wikipages per project
- Backup of previous versions of wikipages as editions

#### Wikilink

Find the wiki button for a project in the menu dropdown.

#### Wikipage detail

![Wikipage detail](https://github.com/funktechno/kanboard-plugin-wiki/blob/master/Asset/images/wikipage.png)

Very similar to task screen. You can edit via a modal. Copies are stored as editions. Should support uploading COMING SOON. Desired look will be to be able to reorder wikipages via dragging on left column.

### Editions Listing

![Editions Listing](https://github.com/funktechno/kanboard-plugin-wiki/blob/master/Asset/images/editionslisting.png)

Can see previous editions saved of a wikipage. Can also restore from this page.
Note that you can only restore **saved** editions. So you if you have the global setting **Saving Editions** as false then you are not currently saving editions when you make changes.

- [issues/bugs](https://github.com/funktechno/kanboard-plugin-wiki/issues)

### Development

After a change must update the version in Plugin.php and Makefile

Plugin.php E.g.

```php
public function getPluginVersion()
{
    return '0.2.6';
}
```

Makefile E.g.

```Makefile
version=0.2.6
```

To run a new build type `make`. NOTE: this only zips files in the last commit in the branch you are on. If you haven't commited your changes these won't be included in the zip.

After testing create a new tag in github or via cli. `git tag -a 0.2.6 -m "Translations Updates"`. Then `git push origin --tags` Then upload the new **Wiki-version.zip** produced from `make`. Then do a pull request on https://github.com/kanboard/website for the plugins.json to update the plugin url. The `version` & `download` attributes are important to be correct.

```json
{
"wiki": {
        "title": "Wiki",
        "version": "0.2.5",
        "author": "lastlink",
        "license": "MIT",
        "description": "Wiki to document projects.",
        "homepage": "https://github.com/funktechno/kanboard-plugin-wiki",
        "readme": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/funktechno/kanboard-plugin-wiki/master/README.md",
        "download": "https://github.com/funktechno/kanboard-plugin-wiki/releases/download/0.2.5-alpha/Wiki-0.2.5.zip",
        "remote_install": true,
        "compatible_version": ">=1.0.37"
    }
}
```
